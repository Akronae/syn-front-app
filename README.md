<img src="https://github.com/Akronae/syneidesis/blob/master/res/marketing/iphone_x-min.png?raw=true" width="1000">

Syneidesis is a proof of concept that uses various Ancient Greek grammatical rules and syntactic deductions to guess a word declension, based on a limited dictionnary and tries to give an accurate translation.  
This tool is meant to read & learn Greek by reading.
It is currently developped based on Koine Greek but is meant to support any dialect later on.
## This work is heavily in progress
